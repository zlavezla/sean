<!--Dogs-->
<h2 style="color: red; text-align: center;"><u>--Dogs--</u></h2>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 23.5px;"> Dogs are loyal, active companions, great for those who enjoy outdoor activities and socializing. They provide unconditional love but need lots of attention, training, and exercise.</br> While dogs can be high-maintenance, they reward owners with deep bonds. Best for energetic, patient individuals ready for a long-term commitment.</p>

<!--Cats-->
<h3 style="color: orangered; text-align: center;"><u>--Cats--</u></h3>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 23.5px;">Cats are independent and low-maintenance, perfect for people with busy lives.</br> They require less attention than dogs and can be left alone longer, but they may be moody or aloof. Cats are ideal for those who prefer a calm environment and want a companion that’s affectionate but doesn’t need constant care.</p>

<!--Rabbits-->
<h4 style="color: white; text-align: center;"><u>--Rabbits--</u></h4>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 23.5px;"> Rabbits are quiet, social pets that can be litter trained and enjoy human interaction. They need space and a proper diet but are easier to care for than larger pets. Great for gentle, patient people willing to create a calm, rabbit-friendly environment.</p>

<!--Hamsters-->
<h5 style="color: darkblue; text-align: center;"><u>--Hamsters--</u></h5>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 23.5px;"> Hamsters are small, low-maintenance pets ideal for children or beginners. They are fun but nocturnal, so they may not be active during the day. With a short lifespan and delicate nature, hamsters are best for those seeking a low-commitment pet.</p>

<!--Parrots-->
<h6 style="color: rebeccapurple; text-align: center;"><u>--Parrots--</u></h6>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 23.5px;">  Parrots are intelligent, social birds known for mimicking speech. They form strong bonds but require a lot of attention, space, and mental stimulation. Parrots are a lifelong commitment, making them best suited for dedicated, patient owners who can provide a stimulating environment.</p>
